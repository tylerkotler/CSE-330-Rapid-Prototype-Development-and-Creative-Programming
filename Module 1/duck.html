        Regrade Policy: <br><br>
It must be objectively clear that an error was made <br>
during grading. Examples of such errors include a grader <br>
incorrectly summing points or incorrectly marking <br>
something not completed. Grades based on the judgement <br>
of the grader, except in extremely extenuating <br>
circumstances, will not be regraded. In particular, <br>
grades for categories like "Site is Visually Appealing" <br>
will not be regraded. All regrade requests must be <br>
submitted by email to cse330ta@gmail.com within one <br>
week of grading. Requests submitted after this deadline <br>
will not be considered. Requests must contain a specific <br>
explanation of the error, including filenames and line <br>
numbers of code, if appropriate.<br>
