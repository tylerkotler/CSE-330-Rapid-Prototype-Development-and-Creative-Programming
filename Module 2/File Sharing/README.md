# Creative portion
For our creative portion we added a part where a person is able to register a new user. 
There is a link to register a new user on the log in page and a user is taken to a register page after clicking this.
When the user wants to create a new username it checks to make sure that the username is not already in user.
If it is not it use, this new username is added to the users.txt file in /srv and a new directory is created in /srv/uploads
