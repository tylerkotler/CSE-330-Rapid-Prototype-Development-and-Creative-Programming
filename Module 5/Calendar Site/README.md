Display Notes:
 - All events are buttons. When you click on them, the event information (title, date, time, description, tag, and creator if the event was made by another user and shared with you) will be displayed below the calendar, including the buttons to edit, delete, and enable/disable the tag.
 - The button to add a new event is below the calendar.
 
Premade Users Notes:
 - There are 2 users that we made already:
  1) Username: jwertheim   Password: jwertheim
  2) Username: tkot   Password: adp
 - They have events shown in March, April, and May 2020
 - They demonstrate the functionality of sharing the calendar and making a group event:
          - jwertheim has his calendar shared with tkot
          - tkot does not have his calendar shared with jwertheim, but he has created a mix of private events that are not shared with anyone and group events that are shared with jwertheim

Creative Portion:
1) Users can tag an event with a particular category and enable/disable those tags in the calendar view.
 - Tags can be chosen when an event is added and edited too. They can be enabled/disabled in the event view when the event is clicked on.
 - An event with black font either means it has no tag or the tag is disabled. This can be seen by enabling/disabling tags and creating or editing events to have a tag or not have a tag. The different colors are associated with different tags (IE: light blue is for sports).
2) Users can share their calendar with additional users.
 - An event with bold font indicates it's one created by you. One with regular font indicates it was either a group event shared with you or an event from an entire calendar shared with you.
3) Users can display group events that display on multiple users calendars.
 - When you are adding a new event, you can add users to share the event with, thus creating a group event. When you click the Add New Event putton and see the display to input the event's information, press the add users button for as many users as you want to share the event with first before you type in any of the usernames.
 - It is OK if you end up creating a group event with another user and sharing your whole calendar with that same user. The code checks to ensure it does not display the event twice in the calendar in this case.
 
Thanks!
