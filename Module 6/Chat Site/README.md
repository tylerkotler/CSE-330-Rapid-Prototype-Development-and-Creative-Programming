# Creative Portion
1) A user can give the ownership of the chatroom to somebody else. This can only be done if the user trying to change the owner is the current owner. The new owner does not have to be in the chatroom to give power of the chatroom. The new owner has  power over the chatroom and the old owner is just like anybody else regarding the chatroom. This then notifies the people in the room of the ownership change (in the message box) and separately gives the new owner an alert that they are now the owner. The new owner cannot change the password of the room (in order to protect the old owner) although the old owner can still be banned (for profanity, etc.). (5 points)

2) A user can change the password of the chatroom. The only user that can change the password of the chatroom is the owner, if they are in the room currently. Additionally, if the user tries to change the password to the same password, this is not allowed and they are notified of the error. If the password change happens, the person who changed the password gets a notification that it is changed, but nobody else does. (5 points)

3) A user cannot create a room with the name of a current room. If a user tries to do this, he/she is alerted of the problem and a room is not created. (1 point)

4) Users are unable to kick or ban themselves from a room. If they try to do so they are told that this is not allowed. (1 point)

5) Enabled a button that allows users to go back to the main chat with ease. (1 point)

6) All users in the room are told when a new user joins the chat or if a user leaves the chat to go to a new chat. (2 points)

# Functionality
- If a user wants to go back to the main room, they type main_room in the room and leave the password blank.
- The current room of the user is displayed in the members box. This updates when the room is changed.
- The user can create a public room by leaving the password blank. However, there is no difference in the way anything else is run between a public room and a private
room (one with a password).
