- Creative Portion (15 points)
    - What we did for the creative portion:
      - Pagination: only a certain number of polls (6) are displayed per page. This prevents the website from being an endless scroll and helps make the website look more professional. Users are able to go to the first page, last page, or the pages surrounding the current page using buttons on the bottom. We applied pagination for the main page, the closed polls page, and a user's poll's page. (10 points)
      - Surveys listed on the main page get sorted by the creator’s points - the more points they choose to spend on a survey, the higher it is listed. Additionally, there is a secondary sort so that if two polls are alotted the same number of points, the newer one is put above the older one. (10 points)
      - User profiles: A user is able to click on the profile of somebody who has created a poll and look at the polls that they have created (both open and closed). This lists the number of polls that a user has, and this page is also paginated (7.5 points).
      - Only registered users are allowed to fill out a survey. Additionally, surveys are only able to be filled out by each user once. This allows for results to be more valid (rather than a user being able to skew results in their favor). (7.5 points)
      - Users receive points for filling out surveys. (5 points)
      - Profile pictures and editing profiles: After a user creates a profile, they are able to edit their profile. This includes changing their username, email, and adding a profile picture. (5 points)
      - Increased functionality with display: A poll is listed, with the date that it was created, as well as the name of the person who created the poll, and the profile picture of the creator of the poll. We also displayed the polls in reverse chronological order (newest first), as you would see on a real website. (5 points)
      - Admin page: User profiles and polls are added to the admin page, allowing for admins of the website to easily delete posts or users who violate the terms and conditions of the website (5 points).
      - Edit polls: Polls are able to be edited by the creator of the poll. You cannot edit the number of points that you have spent on a poll (2.5 points)
    - Ideas:
      - Registered users can go back and edit survey responses (7.5 points)
      - Users receive points for filling out surveys (5 points)
      - Surveys listed on the main page get sorted by the creator’s points - the more points they choose to spend on a survey, the higher it is listed (10 points)
      - Graphs displayed for the results of some quantitative questions of a survey (10 points)
      - Surveys can be targeted (ie only to people registered from ages 18-29) (10 points)
      - Possible distance ranges for respondents to survey (10 points)
